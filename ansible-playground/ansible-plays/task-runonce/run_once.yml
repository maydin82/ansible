# Setting the run_once: yes keyword causes a task to run once for each batch. If you only need to run a task once for all hosts in a play, and the play has multiple batches, then you can add the following conditional to the task:
#when: inventory_hostname == ansible_play_hosts[0]
#This conditional runs the task only for the first host in the play.
